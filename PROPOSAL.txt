Option 1 from piazza

 improve in p9 to implement an out-of-order processor that can achieve a IPC > 1. It must have:
 
    * a branch predictor (reuse from old assignment)
    * can dispatch/commit more than one instruction per cycle (2 is good)
    * continue to use our strange 2-ported memory with superbly unexplained fast fetching
